# UnoThing
This program is made in python3 and is aimed to emulate a real uno game.
What are the basic rules of Uno? The objective of each round of Uno is to be the first player to get rid of all their cards.
The person to the left of the dealer begins, and each player has to put a single card from their hand onto the discard pile, but only if it has a matching colour or number.
